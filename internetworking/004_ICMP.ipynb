    "The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a network protocol that is used to send error messages or to indicate the status of network conditions. It is used by network devices, such as routers, to communicate with each other and to provide information about network conditions to hosts (such as computers).\n",
    "\n",
    "ICMP在第三层, IP协议使用它. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some common uses of ICMP include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Echo Request/Reply (ping): A host can use the ICMP Echo Request message to **test the reachability of another host**. The destination host will **respond with** an ICMP Echo Reply message.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Destination Unreachable: If a network device receives a packet destined for an unreachable host or network, it will send an ICMP Destination Unreachable message back **to the source host** to inform it that the destination cannot be reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time Exceeded: If a packet exceeds the maximum time it is allowed to traverse a network, a network device will send an ICMP Time Exceeded message back to the source host. This is often used to detect and prevent routing loops.\n",

    "Although IP is only a best-effort protocol, the TCP/IP suite does provide for error messages and informational messages when communicating with another **IP device(router)**. These messages are sent using the services of ICMP. The **purpose** of these messages is **to provide feedback** about issues related to the processing of IP packets under certain conditions, **not to make IP reliable**. ICMP messages are not required and are often not allowed within a network for security reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Can ICMP messages be generated by other layers?\n",
    "\n",
    "No, ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) messages can only be generated by the Network Layer (also known as the Internet Layer) of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) reference model.\n",
