    "# Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) vs Routing Information Protocol (RIP)\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "In any **layer 3 devices** there is a table that is normally referred to as the **Routing table** which contains entries for the various network destinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Routing protocols are classified primarily into **Interior gateway protocols(IGP)** and **Exterior gateway protocols (EGP)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**BGP** for all intents and purposes is the most important **EGP**. We are going to discuss an **IGP** called **RIP** in the section below. \n",
    "\n",
    ">BGP and RIP are both routing protocols used to exchange routing information between routers in a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- BGP uses TCP port 179 to communicate with other routers, while RIP uses the UDP as its transport protocol, and is assigned the reserved port number 520. (Both of them works on application layer). \n",
    "\n",
    "- BGP is a **path vector protocol** that uses a complex algorithm to determine the best path for data to travel between different networks, while RIP is a **distance vector protocol** that simply counts the number of router hops between networks to determine the best path.\n",

    "### Autonomous System\n",
    "\n",
    "An Autonomous System is a network under the administrative control of a single organization, like a company. Each ISP is generally considered a single AS as well. Think of it like a house, each house is its own AS, and each room in the house is its own VLAN/Subnet. The streets that connect the houses are the EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol).\n",
    "\n",
    "EGPs are the routing protocols that route information between different AS. The only EGP used now is BGP (Border Gateway Protocol). Also EGPs use ASs (Autonomous System Number) to route information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Routers\n",
    "\n",
    "A router's main function is to forward traffic based on their **routing table**. The **routing table** is populated by two main methods (static and dynamic routing). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Static routing, where routes are entered by the network administrator and remain fixed indefinitely.\n",
    "- Dynamic routing, where routes are decided by a routing protocol and change dynamically as the network topology changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**RIP** is one of the dynamic routing protocol. It is a **distance-vector protocol** that is based on the **Bellman-Ford algorithm**. **BGP** works on **Best path algorithm**.\n"

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A **default route** is a special case of the static route. It is used to avoid including all possible destinations routes in the routing table. Instead, a default route tells a router to forward all traffic to specific next hop. When packets need to be forwarded, the router tries to find a next hop to their destination in the routing table. If the search fails, the router forwards the packets to the next hop provided by the default route.\n",

    "Note: If the next-hop address is on a directly connected network, you can use the interface instead of the next-hop address. For example, if the next-hop address is \"10.0.0.1\" and is connected to the router's \"GigabitEthernet0/0\" interface, you can use the following command instead: `ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 GigabitEthernet0/0`\n",
