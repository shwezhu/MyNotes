Though both technical colleges and vocational colleges boast similar skills-focused curricula, technical college graduates often receive `associate degrees`, whereas vocational graduates primarily earn certificates of completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of trade schools are private, for-profit institutions, but some technical schools, like Western Technical College in Wisconsin, maintain affiliations with community colleges, making them public schools."

This degree allows students to study general education subjects in addition to a few specific courses in disciplines related to their professional goals. You can enter the workforce in a variety of fields or continue studying at a four-year college or university after completing this degree type.

A bachelor’s degree is the most common type of college degree, and it can prepare you to enter the workforce in an entry-level position or to continue studying at the graduate level. Common types of bachelor’s degrees include a `Bachelor of Arts`, a `Bachelor of Science`, a `Bachelor of Fine Arts` and a `Bachelor of Applied Science`.\n",

    "**Master's degree**    \n",
    "A master’s degree is focused on a specific area of research and is usually career-specific. It can enable you to enter the workforce at an advanced level or to pursue a doctoral degree. The most common master’s degrees include a `Master of Arts`, a `Master of Science`, a `Master of Business Administration` and a `Master of Fine Arts`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Doctoral degree**    \n",
    "A doctoral degree is the most advanced degree you can earn. Graduates with these degrees are experts in their fields. An academic doctoral degree is a Doctor of Philosophy or Ph.D. These degrees focus primarily on research in a specific field, and the people who earn them often become professors or researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Professional degree**    \n",
    "A professional degree is also a doctoral degree, but one that is required for certain careers. Common professional doctorates include a Juris Doctor to practice law, a Doctor of Medicine to become a physician, a Doctor of Education for educational leadership roles and a Doctor of Pharmacy to work in the pharmaceutical industry.\n",
