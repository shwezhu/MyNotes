    "\n",
    "1. does 就是助动词； eat 就是主动词。\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Does eat 合在一起就是**谓语动词**。\n",

    "助动词有很多, have, will, must, may, should, be, do, 这都是助动词, 都可以用到疑问句中, 每个助动词都有自己的时态和形式别忘了, 比如 do, 你提问的时候可以问 Do you, did you, does he, 等等\n",

    "## 特殊疑问句\n",
    "\n",
    "疑问词放至句首，**（找be, can, would, will, 等助动词）抄在疑问词后，没有则用do，does**，改（出现some，要考虑是否改为any。出现I 改为 you, 出现 we 改为 you ,出现my 改为your,出现our改为your。最后是加问号\n",
    "\n",
    "例子:\n",
    "\n",
    "I usually get up at six forty .--- `When` `do` you usually get up?　没找到助动词,就用do/does代替, 因为是问什么时候, 所以用when.\n",
    "\n",
    "I can see five birds in the tree.---`How many` birds can you see?　 问多少, 所以选how many, 找到了助动词can,所以不用加do/does. 但是这个还特殊, 把birds提前了, 然后再放 can, 这种类型的都是这么问, \n",
    "\n",
    "比如, There are three apples. ---`How many` apples are here? 因为are(be动词)也属于助动词. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is my shirt . ---`Whose` shirt is that?　找到主动词is, 因此不用do/does\n",
    "\n",
    "They are five yuan. -- `How much` are they?\n",
    "\n",
    "I like math best. --`What subject` `do` you like best? 这句就比较像上面的how many的例子, 疑问词后面不是直接跟助动词而是要问的东西,自己体会语感.\n",
    "\n",
    "They bought a new bike yesterday. --`What` `did` they buy yesterday? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1、陈述句 You are from where. 一般疑问句 Are you from where? 特殊疑问句 Where are you from?\n",
