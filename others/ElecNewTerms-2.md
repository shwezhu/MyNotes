Imagine a shaft of yellow sunlight beaming through a window. According to quantum physics that beam is made of zillions of tiny packets of light, called photons, streaming through the air. But what exactly is a photon?

> Light is made of particles called photons, bundles of the electromagnetic field that carry a specific amount of energy.

But don’t think of photons like they are `pool balls`. They’re also wave-like: they can interfere with each other to produce patterns of light and darkness. The `photon` model was one of the first triumphs of `quantum physics`; later work showed that `electrons` and other particles of matter also have wave-like properties.

#### 1.1. History
Later, around 300 BC, the ancient Greek physicist `Euclid` made a huge breakthrough when he posited light traveled in straight lines. 

1690, by this time, scientists had split into two entrenched camps. One side believed that light was a wave while the other view was of light as particles or corpuscles. The great champion of the so-called ‘corpuscularists’ was none other than `Isaac Newton`, widely believed as the greatest scientist ever. 

“The agreement of the results seems to show that light and magnetism are affections of the same substance, and light is an electromagnetic disturbance propagated through the field according to `electromagnetic laws`”, wrote Maxwell in 1865.

From that day forward, the concept of light was united with those of electricity and magnetism for the first time.

+ Not only is light made up of photons, but all electromagnetic energy (i.e. microwaves, radio waves, X-rays) is made up of photons.

+ Photons are always electrically neutral. They have no `electrical charge`.

+ Photons do not `decay` on their own.
