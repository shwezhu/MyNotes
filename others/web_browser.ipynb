    "---\n",
    "In the computer network engineering and design realm, a Request for Comments (RFC) is a `memorandum` published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) describing methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet, along with Internet-connected systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the organization known as the Internet Society, designers, engineers, and computer scientists can publish papers or discourses in the form of an RFC, either for `peer review` or simply to share new concepts, information, or (occasionally) engineering humor. Peer review is an important process of `subjecting` your work, research, or personal ideas to the scrutiny of others who are usually considered to be experts in the same field. The **IETF** will then **adopt** some of the **proposals** published as RFCs **as “Internet Standards.”**        \n",
    "\n",
    "#### history\n",
    "The beginning of the RFC format and process occurred in `1969` as part of the original `ARPANET project`, which was a `wide-area experimental network` connecting hosts and terminal servers together. Procedures were set up to regulate the allocation of addresses, and to create voluntary standards for the network. The authors of the first RFCs actually used typewriters to create their work and passed hard copies among the ARPA researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the modern RFCs, many of the `early RFCs` were `actual` requests for comments. The RFC left questions open and was written in a less formal style. This less formal style is now typical of Internet Draft documents, the `precursor step` before being `approved` as an RFC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RFCs turned out to provide a convenient, useful vehicle for documentation and distribution of the research performed by the developers of the Internet, and `ended up` becoming the `official record` of the `Internet's design decisions`, architecture, and `technical standards`. Although they remained named \"Request For Comments,” `by consensus` they are the Internet documents of record, and often include very detailed technical information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, working groups of the **IETF  do  most of the work** on **standardization** of Internet protocols **as they go through proposed standard**, draft standard, and actual standard phases. \n"

    "\n",
    "By insisting on following its own path with IE rather than follow generally accepted standards, Microsoft **dictated(主宰)** web design by years. Keeping too many old browsers in circulation contributed to that mess. Thankfully, the time has come to move on. 保持太多旧浏览器的流通导致了这种混乱。\n",

    "\n",
    "Desperate designers **cobbled together(拼凑)** ways of making sites work across multiple browsers, but a complex layout sometimes required numerous **workarounds**. And Internet Explorer 6 **was notorious for** **security vulnerabilities(安全漏洞)** that Microsoft was sometimes slow to **patch**. Internet Explorer 6 因安全漏洞而臭名昭著，Microsoft 有时修补这些漏洞的速度很慢。\n",

    "\n",

By the time Microsoft caught up to the rest of the browser market, the damage to Internet Explorer's reputation had already been done.\n",

They are `aggressively` pushing to get people off of IE.\n",

Safari is second with about 10 percent. That’s a fairly large population on its own, but the bigger reason developers have to pay attention to Safari is because of its mobile version on iOS and iPadOS.\n",

    "The vast majority of iPhone users use Safari. But it’s also important to know that Safari’s engine, `WebKit`, is the only browser engine allowed on iOS. Even Chrome and Firefox for iOS have to use WebKit `under the hood` to `comply with` Apple’s App Store review guidelines:\n",

    "On the surface, the situation with Safari seems similar to our old situation with IE, but there are crucial differences that make it hard to `justify` referring to Safari as the next IE. Even if Safari is slower than the other browsers at fixing bugs and implementing features, at least we can expect those changes to make it to end users much faster than they did for IE users.\n",

    "The pain of dealing with Safari-specific issues is not in the same `realm` as what web developers had to deal with in supporting IE users. There will inevitably be some degree of difficulty in maintaining `cross-browser compatibility`, but the challenge is much easier now, especially because resources like `Can I use` and `MDN` make incompatibilities easy to know about ahead of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily for us, no browser is truly taking up IE’s mantle. I don’t blame any developers who complain about Safari, but there’s a `categorical difference` in developing for Safari now versus developing for IE in the past. 但是现在为 Safari 开发与过去为 IE 开发存在绝对差异。I, `for one 一方面`, am thankful for that. "
