    "---\n",
    "In the computer network engineering and design realm, a Request for Comments (RFC) is a `memorandum` published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) describing methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet, along with Internet-connected systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the organization known as the Internet Society, designers, engineers, and computer scientists can publish papers or discourses in the form of an RFC, either for `peer review` or simply to share new concepts, information, or (occasionally) engineering humor. Peer review is an important process of `subjecting` your work, research, or personal ideas to the scrutiny of others who are usually considered to be experts in the same field. The **IETF** will then **adopt** some of the **proposals** published as RFCs **as “Internet Standards.”**        \n",
    "\n",
    "#### history\n",
    "The beginning of the RFC format and process occurred in `1969` as part of the original `ARPANET project`, which was a `wide-area experimental network` connecting hosts and terminal servers together. Procedures were set up to regulate the allocation of addresses, and to create voluntary standards for the network. The authors of the first RFCs actually used typewriters to create their work and passed hard copies among the ARPA researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the modern RFCs, many of the `early RFCs` were `actual` requests for comments. The RFC left questions open and was written in a less formal style. This less formal style is now typical of Internet Draft documents, the `precursor step` before being `approved` as an RFC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RFCs turned out to provide a convenient, useful vehicle for documentation and distribution of the research performed by the developers of the Internet, and `ended up` becoming the `official record` of the `Internet's design decisions`, architecture, and `technical standards`. Although they remained named \"Request For Comments,” `by consensus` they are the Internet documents of record, and often include very detailed technical information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, working groups of the **IETF  do  most of the work** on **standardization** of Internet protocols **as they go through proposed standard**, draft standard, and actual standard phases. \n"

    "\n",

Microsoft services will drop support in 2021, and Windows will start to automatically launch certain websites in Edge when users try to open them in IE. They are `aggressively` pushing to get people off of IE.\n",
