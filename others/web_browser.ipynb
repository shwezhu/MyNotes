    "---\n",
    "In the computer network engineering and design realm, a Request for Comments (RFC) is a `memorandum` published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) describing methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet, along with Internet-connected systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the organization known as the Internet Society, designers, engineers, and computer scientists can publish papers or discourses in the form of an RFC, either for `peer review` or simply to share new concepts, information, or (occasionally) engineering humor. Peer review is an important process of `subjecting` your work, research, or personal ideas to the scrutiny of others who are usually considered to be experts in the same field. The **IETF** will then **adopt** some of the **proposals** published as RFCs **as “Internet Standards.”**        \n",
    "\n",
    "#### history\n",
    "The beginning of the RFC format and process occurred in `1969` as part of the original `ARPANET project`, which was a `wide-area experimental network` connecting hosts and terminal servers together. Procedures were set up to regulate the allocation of addresses, and to create voluntary standards for the network. The authors of the first RFCs actually used typewriters to create their work and passed hard copies among the ARPA researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the modern RFCs, many of the `early RFCs` were `actual` requests for comments. The RFC left questions open and was written in a less formal style. This less formal style is now typical of Internet Draft documents, the `precursor step` before being `approved` as an RFC.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RFCs turned out to provide a convenient, useful vehicle for documentation and distribution of the research performed by the developers of the Internet, and `ended up` becoming the `official record` of the `Internet's design decisions`, architecture, and `technical standards`. Although they remained named \"Request For Comments,” `by consensus` they are the Internet documents of record, and often include very detailed technical information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, working groups of the **IETF  do  most of the work** on **standardization** of Internet protocols **as they go through proposed standard**, draft standard, and actual standard phases. \n"

    "Newer web browser still have their **quirks**, and sites might look different from one browser to the next. But these differences are small compared to how Internet Explorer **mangled** web pages in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n",
    "\n",
    "By insisting on following its own path with IE rather than follow generally accepted standards, Microsoft **dictated(主宰)** web design by years. Keeping too many old browsers in circulation contributed to that mess. Thankfully, the time has come to move on. 保持太多旧浏览器的流通导致了这种混乱。\n",

    "Because Internet Explorer didn't stick to the guidelines established by World Wide Web Consortium the organization that establishes standards for web technologies, it often would display web pages in ways that made them look entirely different from other browsers, such as Netscape, Opera or, later, Firefox. \n",
    "\n",
    "Desperate designers **cobbled together(拼凑)** ways of making sites work across multiple browsers, but a complex layout sometimes required numerous **workarounds**. And Internet Explorer 6 **was notorious for** **security vulnerabilities(安全漏洞)** that Microsoft was sometimes slow to **patch**. Internet Explorer 6 因安全漏洞而臭名昭著，Microsoft 有时修补这些漏洞的速度很慢。\n",

    "\n",
