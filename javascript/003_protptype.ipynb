    "Every `object` in JavaScript has a **built-in property**, which is called its `prototype`. The `prototype` is itself an `object`, so the `prototype` will have its own `prototype`, making what's called a **prototype chain**. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has `null` for its own prototype. 每个对象都有一个属性,那就是`prototype`, 所以这就像是个无限套娃, 但是是有限的, 到null就没了. 然后记住prototype是每个对象都拥有的属性, 同时它本身也是一个对象, 所以这就形成了一个chain. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The **property of an object** that points to its prototype is **not** called prototype. Its name is not standard, but in practice all browsers use `__proto__`. The standard way to access an object's prototype is the `Object.getPrototypeOf()` method.  这句话的意思是说,想要访问一个对象的prototype, 不可以像类似这种`obj.prototype`来访问, 而应该是`obj.__proto__`, 但是呢这种方式也不是很规范, **应该使用全局函数`Object.getPrototypeOf()`去查看一个对象的prototype属性**. \n",
    "\n",
    "关于一个对象prototype属性,还有一个迷惑的地方, 就是你通过`obj.prototype`访问到的并不是上面我们讨论的prototype, 已经说了, 只能通过`obj.__proto__`和全局函数`Object.getPrototypeOf()`来获取一个对象的`prototype`属性. 文章下面我会接着说, 现在先看重点\n",

    "\n",
    "When you try to access a property of an object: if the property can't be found in the object itself, the prototype is searched for the property. If the property still can't be found, then the prototype's prototype is searched, and so on until either the property is found, or the end of the chain is reached, in which case `undefined` is returned. 比如你要访问一个对象的name属性,或者是调用一个对象的函数, 如果这个对象没有你要调用的函数或者要访问的属性, 那就会自动搜索这个对象的prototype(prototype本身也是个对象)的函数和属性, 试图找到你要调用的函数或属性. \n",

If it doesn't have it, then it looks at that object's `__proto__` property and so on...until the chain ends. Thus the name **prototype chain**.\n",

    "所以为了防止这种冗余产生, `__proto__`来救场了, 使用它, 你可以让无数对象共用同一个函数, 有点像c++里面虚函数的意思(emm是吗? 不确定).\n",
