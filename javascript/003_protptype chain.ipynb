    "Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its `prototype`. The `prototype` is itself an object, so the `prototype` will have its own `prototype`, making what's called a **prototype chain**. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has `null` for its own prototype. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: The property of an object that points to its `prototype` is **not** called `prototype`. Its name is not standard, but in practice all browsers use `__proto__`. The **standard way** to access an object's prototype is the `Object.getPrototypeOf()` method. \n",
    "\n",
    "关于prototype有一个迷惑的地方, 通过`obj.prototype`访问到的并不是上面我们讨论的prototype, 只能通过`obj.__proto__`和全局函数`Object.getPrototypeOf()`来获取一个对象的`prototype`属性. 文章下面我会接着说, 现在先看重点\n",

    "## prototype chain 的意义\n",
    "\n",
    "比如你要访问一个对象的name属性,或者是调用一个对象的函数, 如果这个对象没有你要调用的函数或者要访问的属性, 那就会自动搜索这个对象的prototype(prototype本身也是个对象)的函数和属性, 一直找到prototype chain的末端. ummm,感觉有点熟悉? 是不是想到了java,cpp里的继承机制. 没错, prototype chain这种机制正式帮助javascript实现了对象之间的继承,而不是类之间的继承, 所以它是prototypal inheritance而不是classical inheritance, 具体会放到`MyNotes/javascript/prototypal Inheritance`里讲. \n",

    "You may wonder: Why does JavaScript has `__proto__`property created on every single object? Well, one word: **delegation**. When you call a property on an object and the object doesn't have it, then JavaScript looks for the object referenced by __proto__ to see if it maybe has it. If it doesn't have it, then it looks at that object's `__proto__` property and so on...until the chain ends. Thus the name **prototype chain**.\n",
