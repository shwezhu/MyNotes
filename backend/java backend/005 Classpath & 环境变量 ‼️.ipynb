    "It would be impractical to have the VM look through every folder on your machine, so you have to provide the VM a list of places to look. This is done by putting folder and jar files on your classpath.\n",

    "Before we talk about how the classpath is set, let's talk about `.class` files, `packages`, and `.jar` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's suppose that `MyClass` is something you built as part of your project, and it is in a directory in your project called `greenhouse`. The .class file would be at `greenhouse/org/javaguy/coolframework/MyClass.class`, In order to get to that file, your path would simply need to contain the folder `greenhouse`, not the whole package structure, **since your import statement provides all that information** to the VM. JVM需要的是class文件而不是源码.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's suppose that you bundle `CoolFramework` up into a `.jar` file, and put that `CoolFramework.jar` into a lib directory in your project. You would now need to put `lib/CoolFramework.jar` into your classpath. The VM will look inside the jar file for the `org/javaguy/coolframework` part, and find your class.\n",
