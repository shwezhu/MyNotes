    "\n",
    "**venv** (for Python 3) and **virtualenv** (for Python 2) allow you to manage separate package installations for different projects. They essentially allow you to create a “virtual” isolated Python installation and install packages into that virtual installation.

It is always recommended to use a virtual environment while developing Python applications.\n",
