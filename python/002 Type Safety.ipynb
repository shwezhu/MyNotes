    "> There is no precise technical definition of what the terms mean and different authors disagree about the implied meaning of the terms and the relative rankings of the \"strength\" of the type systems of mainstream programming languages. For this reason, writers who wish to write unambiguously about type systems often eschew the terms \"strong typing\" and \"weak typing\" in favor of specific expressions such as \"type safety\". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing\n",
    "\n",
    "对于是否python是类型安全并没有一个一致的观点, 因为证明一个语言是否类型安全本就需要去做大量的验证, 并不是简单的一个字符串和整数相加测试报错就是说明它是类型安全. \n",
    "\n",
    "常见的[测试方法](https://qr.ae/prSKpQ):\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> a = 10 \n",
    ">>> b = \"hello\" \n",
    ">>> a + b\n",
    "// 报错, python\n",
    "\n",
    "> let a = 10 \n",
    "> let b = \"hello\" \n",

    "> In computer science, **type safety** is the extent to which a programming language discourages or prevents **type errors**. Type safety is sometimes alternatively considered to be a property of facilities of a computer language; that is, some facilities are type-safe and their usage will not result in **type errors**, while other facilities in the same language may be **type-unsafe** and a program using them may encounter **type errors**. The behaviors classified as **type errors** are usually that result from attempts to perform operations on values that are not of the appropriate data type, e.g., adding a string to an integer when there's no definition on how to handle this case. **This classification is partly based on opinion**. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_safety\n",

    "> An intuitive notion of type safety is pithily summarized by the phrase, ***“Well typed programs cannot go wrong.”*** This phrase was coined by Robin Milner in his 1978 paper, A Theory of Type Polymorphism in Programming.

    "#### Going wrong\n",
    "Programming languages are defined by their **syntax** — what programs you’re allowed to write down — and **semantics** — what those programs mean. A problem **all languages face** is that there are many programs that are **syntactically valid** but are **semantically problematic**. A classic English example is Chomsky’s “Colorless green ideals sleep furiously”—perfectly syntactically correct, but meaningless. A example in the OCaml programming language is 1 + “foo”; according to the language’s semantics, such a program has no meaning. Another example is { char buf[4]; buf[4] = ‘x’ } in C: the write to index 4 is outside the declared bounds of the buffer, and the language specification deems this action to be undefined, i.e., meaningless. If we were to run such meaningless programs, we could say that they would go wrong.\n",

    "#### Well typed ⟹ Cannot go wrong\n",
