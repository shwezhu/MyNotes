    "# Java 8 Streams\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, Java 8 Streams should not be confused with Java I/O streams (ex: `FileInputStream` etc); these have very little to do with each other. This functionality – `java.util.stream` – adds support **functional-style** operations on streams of elements, such as `map`, `reduce` on collections. https://stackify.com/streams-guide-java-8/\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to iterate over a list of integers and find out sum of all the integers greater than 10. Prior to Java 8, the approach to do it would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "private static int sumIterator(List<Integer> list) {\n",
    "\tIterator<Integer> it = list.iterator();\n",
    "\tint sum = 0;\n",
    "\twhile (it.hasNext()) {\n",
    "\t\tint num = it.next();\n",
    "\t\tif (num > 10) {\n",
    "\t\t\tsum += num;\n",
    "\t\t}\n",
    "\t}\n",
    "\treturn sum;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- We just want to know the sum of integers but we would also have to provide how the iteration will take place, this is also called **external iteration** because client program is handling the algorithm to iterate over the list.\n",
    "- The program is sequential in nature, there is no way we can do this in parallel easily.\n",
    "- There is a lot of code to do even a simple task.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome all the above shortcomings, Java 8 Stream API was introduced. We can use Java Stream API to implement **internal iteration**, that is better because java framework is in control of the iteration. **Internal iteration** provides several features such as sequential and parallel execution, filtering based on the given criteria, mapping etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the Java 8 Stream API method arguments are functional interfaces, so lambda expressions work very well with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "private static int sumStream(List<Integer> list) {\n",
    "\treturn list.stream().filter(i -> i > 10).mapToInt(i -> i).sum();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we can use primitive data types such as `int`, `long` in the collections using **auto-boxing** and these operations could take a lot of time, there are specific classes for primitive types - `IntStream`, `LongStream` and `DoubleStream`.\n"

    "# Intermediate & Terminal Operations\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Java Stream API operations that returns a new Stream are called intermediate operations. Most of the times, these operations are lazy in nature, so they start producing new stream elements and send it to the next operation. Intermediate operations are never the final result producing operations. Commonly used intermediate operations are `filter` and `map`. Java 8 Stream API operations that returns a result or produce a side effect. Once the terminal method is called on a stream, **it consumes the stream** and after that we can’t use stream. Commonly used terminal methods are `forEach`, `toArray`, `reduce`, `max`, `anyMatch` etc. You can identify terminal methods from the return type, they will never return a Stream. \n",
    "\n",
    "上面那句Terminal Operations会consume Stream, 然后再看: \n",
    "\n",
    "Java Streams are consumable, so there is no way to create a reference to stream for future usage. Since the data is on-demand, **it’s not possible to reuse** the same stream multiple times. \n",
    "\n",
    "再看collection和stream的对比:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **collection** is an in-memory data structure to hold values and before we start using collection, all the values should have been populated. Whereas a java **Stream** doesn’t store data, it operates on the source data structure (collection and array) and **produce pipelined data** that we can use and perform specific operations(`reduce()`, `toArray()`, `max()`).\n",

    "这个程序的目的是分组计数, 就是想统计一下多少岁的各有多少人, 最后打印类似`{12: 3, 15: 1}`的数据. \n",
    "\n",

    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "上面这个程序, 没有报错, 看着很正常, 可是, 最后却打印了`{}`, 也就是说HashMap是空的! 这是怎么回事, 难道if判断条件有问题吗? 在if里打印点东西试试: \n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "arr.stream().peek((ele) -> {\n",
    "            if (!json.containsKey(ele.age)) {\n",
    "                System.out.println(\"put\");\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "你觉得这次至少打印点东西了吧, 其实, 什么都没打印, 还是只打印了`{}`!\n",
    "\n",
    "这是咋回事? 看看上面说的,  \n",
    "\n",
    "Java Stream is a data structure that is **computed on-demand**. All intermediate operations are lazy, and, as a result, **no operations will have any effect until the pipeline starts to work**. peek()是一个intermediate operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "所以原因就知道了: 直到我们apply terminal operation to a Stream的时候, 之前应用到pipeline的操作(peek, map, etc)才会开始工作: it's an intermediate operation and we didn't apply a terminal operation to the pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "所以解决办法很简单, 就是对peek产生的stream应用一个terminal operation, 比如forEach. \n",
