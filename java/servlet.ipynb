    "### ServletContext\n",
    "When the servlet container (like Apache Tomcat) starts up, it will deploy and load all its web applications. When a web application is loaded, the servlet container creates the `ServletContext` once and keeps it in the server's memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Interface ServletContext:     \n",
    "public interface ServletContext     \n",
    "Defines a set of methods that a servlet uses to communicate with its servlet container, for example, to get the MIME type of a file, dispatch requests, or write to a log file.        \n",
    "There is one context per \"web application\" per Java Virtual Machine. (A \"web application\" is a collection of servlets and content installed under a specific subset of the server's URL namespace such as /catalog and possibly installed via a .war file.)     \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The web app's `web.xml` and all of included `web-fragment.xml` files is parsed, and each `<servlet>`, `<filter> `and `<listener>` found (or each class annotated with `@WebServlet`, `@WebFilter` and `@WebListener` respectively) is instantiated once and kept in the server's memory as well. For each instantiated filter, its `init()` method is invoked with a new `FilterConfig`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a Servlet has a `<servlet><load-on-startup>` or `@WebServlet(loadOnStartup)` value greater than `0`, then its `init()` method is also invoked during startup with a new `ServletConfig`. Those servlets are initialized in the same order specified by that value (`1` is 1st, `2` is 2nd, etc). If the same value is specified for more than one servlet, then each of those servlets is loaded in the same order as they appear in the `web.xml`, `web-fragment.xml`, or `@WebServlet` classloading. In the event the \"load-on-startup\" value is absent, the `init()` method will be invoked whenever the HTTP request hits that servlet for the very first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the servlet container is finished with all of the above described initialization steps, then the `ServletContextListener#contextInitialized()` will be invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the servlet container shuts down, it unloads all web applications, invokes the `destroy()` method of all its initialized servlets and filters, and all `ServletContext`, `Servlet`, `Filter` and `Listener` instances are trashed. Finally the `ServletContextListener#contextDestroyed()` will be invoked.\n",

    "### HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse\n",
    "\n",
    "The servlet container is attached to a web server that listens for HTTP requests on a certain port number (port 8080 is usually used during development and port 80 in production). When a client (e.g. user with a web browser, or programmatically using `URLConnection`) sends an HTTP request, the servlet container creates new `HttpServletRequest` and `HttpServletResponse` objects and passes them through any defined `Filter` in the chain and, eventually, the `Servlet` instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of filters, the `doFilter()` method is invoked. When the servlet container's code calls `chain.doFilter(request, response)`, the request and response continue on to the next filter, or hit the servlet if there are no remaining filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of servlets, the `service()` method is invoked. By default, this method determines which one of the `doXxx()` methods to invoke based off of `request.getMethod()`. If the determined method is absent from the servlet, then an HTTP 405 error is returned in the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "The request object provides access to all of the information about the HTTP request, such as its URL, headers, query string and body. The response object provides the ability to control and send the HTTP response the way you want by, for instance, allowing you to set the headers and the body (usually with generated HTML content from a JSP file). When the HTTP response is committed and finished, both the request and response objects are recycled and made available for reuse."

    "### HttpSession\n",
    "\n",
    "When a client visits the webapp for the first time and/or the `HttpSession` is obtained for the first time via `request.getSession()`, the servlet container creates a new `HttpSession` object, generates a long and unique ID (which you can get by `session.getId()`), and stores it in the server's memory. The servlet container also sets a `Cookie` in the `Set-Cookie` header of the HTTP response with `JSESSIONID` as its name and the unique session ID as its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As per the HTTP `cookie` specification (a contract any decent web browser and web server must adhere to), the client (the web browser) is required to send this cookie back in subsequent requests in the Cookie header for as long as the cookie is valid (i.e. the unique ID must refer to an unexpired session and the domain and path are correct). Using your browser's built-in HTTP traffic monitor, you can verify that the `cookie` is valid (press F12 in Chrome / Firefox 23+ / IE9+, and check the Net/Network tab). The servlet container will check the Cookie header of every incoming HTTP request for the presence of the cookie with the name `JSESSIONID` and use its value (the session ID) to get the associated `HttpSession` from server's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `HttpSession` stays alive until it has been idle (i.e. not used in a request) for more than the timeout value specified in `<session-timeout>`, a setting in `web.xml`. The timeout value defaults to 30 minutes. So, when the client doesn't visit the web app for longer than the time specified, the servlet container trashes the session. Every subsequent request, even with the cookie specified, will not have access to the same session anymore; the servlet container will create a new session.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "On the client side, the session cookie stays alive for as long as the browser instance is running. So, if the client closes the browser instance (all tabs/windows), then the session is trashed on the client's side. In a new browser instance, the cookie associated with the session wouldn't exist, so it would no longer be sent. This causes an entirely new `HttpSession` to be created, with an entirely new session cookie being used.\n"

    "### Thread Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, your major concern is possibly thread safety. You should now know that servlets and filters are shared among all requests. That's the nice thing about Java, it's multithreaded and different threads (read: HTTP requests) can make use of the same instance. It would otherwise be too expensive to recreate, `init()` and `destroy()` them for every single request.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also realize that you should **never** assign any request or session scoped data as an instance variable of a servlet or filter. It will be shared among all other requests in other sessions. That's not thread-safe! The below example illustrates this:\n",
