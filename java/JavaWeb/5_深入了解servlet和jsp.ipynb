    "## 1. Life cycle of a servlet\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "A servlet life cycle can be defined as the entire process from its creation till the destruction. The following are the paths followed by a servlet.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The servlet is initialized by calling the init() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The servlet calls service() method to process a client's request.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The servlet is terminated by calling the destroy() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Finally, servlet is garbage collected by the garbage collector of the JVM\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. The init() Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The init method is called only once. It is called **only** when the servlet is created, and not called for any user requests afterwards. So, it is used for one-time initializations, just as with the init method of applets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The servlet is normally created when a user first invokes a URL corresponding to the servlet, but you can also specify that the servlet be loaded when the server is first started.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a user invokes a servlet, a single instance of each servlet gets created, with each user request resulting in a new thread that is handed off to doGet or doPost as appropriate. The init() method simply creates or loads some data that will be used throughout the life of the servlet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "//init() method\n",
    "\n",
    "public class MyServlet implements Servlet{\n",
    "   public void init(ServletConfig config) throws ServletException {\n",
    "        //initialization code\n",
    "   }\n",
    "    //rest of code\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. The service() Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The service() method is the main method to perform the actual task. The servlet container (i.e. tomcat) calls the service() method to handle requests coming from the client( browsers) and to write the formatted response back to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time the web server receives a request for a servlet, the server spawns(产卵) a new thread and calls service. The service() method checks the HTTP request type (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and calls doGet, doPost, doPut, doDelete, etc. methods as appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "// service() method\n",
    "\n",
    "public class MyServlet implements Servlet{\n",
    "    \n",
    "    public void service(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response) \n",
    "        throws ServletException, IOException {\n",
    "        \n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The service () method is called by the container and service method invokes doGet, doPost, doPut, doDelete, etc. methods as appropriate. So you have nothing to do with service() method but you override either doGet() or doPost() depending on what type of request you receive from the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.1. The doGet() Method\n",
    "\n",
    "A GET request results from a normal request for a URL or from an HTML form that has no METHOD specified and it should be handled by doGet() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)\n",
    "   throws ServletException, IOException {\n",
    "   // Servlet code\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.2. The doPost() Method\n",
    "A POST request results from an HTML form that specifically lists POST as the METHOD and it should be handled by doPost() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)\n",
    "   throws ServletException, IOException {\n",
    "   // Servlet code\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3. The destroy() Method\n",
    "The destroy() method is called **only once** at the end of the life cycle of a servlet. This method gives your servlet a chance to close database connections, halt background threads, write cookie lists or hit counts to disk, and perform other such cleanup activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the destroy() method is called, the servlet object is marked for garbage collection. The destroy method definition looks like this −\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void destroy() {\n",
    "   // Finalization code...\n",
    "}\n",

    "### 1.4. The following is a typical user scenario of these methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assume that a HTTP requests to visit a URL.\n",
    "    + The browser then generates an HTTP request for this URL.\n",
    "    + This request is then sent to the appropriate server.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `HTTP request` is received by the web server and forwarded to the `servlet container`.\n",
    "    + The `container` maps this request to a particular `servlet`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. The `container` invokes the `init()` method of the `servlet`.\n",
    "    + This method is invoked only when the servlet is first loaded into memory.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. The `container` invokes the `service()` method of the `servlet`.\n",
    "    + This method is called to process the `HTTP request`.\n",
    "    + The servlet may read data that has been provided in the HTTP request.\n",
    "    + The servlet may also formulate an `HTTP response` for the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The servlet remains in the container's address space and is available to process any other HTTP requests received from clients.\n",
    "    + The `service()` method is called for each `HTTP request`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The container may, at some point, decide to unload the servlet from its memory.\n",
    "    + The algorithms by which this decision is made are specific to each container.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "7. The container calls the servlet's `destroy()` method to relinquish any resources such as file handles that are allocated for the servlet; important data may be saved to a persistent store.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The memory allocated for the servlet and its objects can then be garbage collected."

    "\n",
    "### 2.1. JSP Compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "When a browser asks for a JSP, the JSP engine first checks to see whether it needs to compile the page. If the page has never been compiled, or if the JSP has been modified since it was last compiled, the JSP engine compiles the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "The compilation process involves three steps −\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Parsing the JSP.\n",
    "+ Turning the JSP into a servlet.\n",
    "+ Compiling the servlet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. JSP Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "When a container loads a JSP it invokes the jspInit() method before servicing any requests. If you need to perform JSP-specific initialization, override the jspInit() method −\n",

    "public void jspInit(){\n",
    "   // Initialization code...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, initialization is performed only once and as with the servlet init method, you generally initialize database connections, open files, and create lookup tables in the jspInit method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. JSP Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "This phase of the JSP life cycle represents all interactions with requests until the JSP is destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a browser requests a JSP and the page has been loaded and initialized, the JSP engine invokes the **_jspService()** method in the JSP.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **_jspService()** method takes an HttpServletRequest and an HttpServletResponse as its parameters as follows −\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "void _jspService(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {\n",
    "   // Service handling code...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The **_jspService()** method of a JSP is invoked on request basis. This is responsible for generating the response for that request and this method is also responsible for generating responses to all seven of the HTTP methods, i.e, GET, POST, DELETE, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4. JSP Cleanup\n",
    "\n",
    "The destruction phase of the JSP life cycle represents when a JSP is being removed from use by a container.\n",
    "\n",
    "The jspDestroy() method is the JSP equivalent of the destroy method for servlets. Override jspDestroy when you need to perform any cleanup, such as releasing database connections or closing open files.\n",

    "The jspDestroy() method has the following form −\n",
