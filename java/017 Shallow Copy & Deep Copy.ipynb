    "# Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy\n",

    "\n",
    "In Java, a copy of an object can be made using either a shallow copy or a deep copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **shallow copy** creates a new object that is a duplicate of the original object, but the new object's fields reference the same objects as the original object's fields. In other words, a shallow copy creates a new object with the same values as the original object, but any objects referenced by the original object are not copied. Instead, the new object simply references the same objects as the original object. Shallow copying can be done using the clone() method or by copying object references.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a deep copy creates a new object that is a duplicate of the original object, including all objects referenced by the original object. In other words, a deep copy creates a new object with the same values as the original object, and all objects referenced by the original object are also copied. Deep copying can be done by copying all fields of the original object, including any objects referenced by those fields.\n",
