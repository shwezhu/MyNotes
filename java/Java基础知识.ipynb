    "\n",
    "There are 8: boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float and double.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Unlike C, C++ and similar languages, Java can't represent false as 0 or null and can't represent true as non-zero. Java can't cast from boolean to a non-boolean primitive data type, or vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Non-primitive data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Primitive data types in java are also called reference types because they refer to objects. Non-primitive data types are created by the programmer and they are not predefined. Since non-primitives are referred to as objects they can be assigned with null, which is not a case in primitive type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike primitive data types, a non-primitive data type must start with an upper case letter. All the non-primitive data types are of equal size and consume equal memory on disk which is different in the case of primitive data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 String\n",
    "\n",
    "A string is a special data type in java, where it contradicts the fact that non-primitive types are defined by programmers. The string data type is a non-primitive data type but it is predefined in java, some people also call it a special ninth primitive data type.\n"
